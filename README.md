### 🌟 My Philosophy: AI as a Partner, Not a Replacement  
**Why focus on control and ownership?**  
- **Creativity thrives on agency.** Automated, one-click solutions often strip away the joy of discovery and personal touch.  
- **Empowering creators builds pride.** Tools should adapt to the user’s vision, not impose their own.  
- **Collaboration over substitution.** AI should assist and inspire rather than replace human creativity.
